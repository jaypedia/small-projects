# Simple Todo List

## What I learned

### HTML
- semantic tag
- form action
- aria-label(input's attribute)
  - to keep it as accessible as possible, so a screen reader will know what the purpose of this input
- data-\* Attribute
  - to store custom data private to the application
- `<template>` tag

### CSS
- grid
- font-size: calc(7vw + 2rem)
  - 2rem sets a minimum size - the font can never be smaller than that. 
  - And 7 viewport width means - if screen gets bigger, it will grow with the screen, and vice versa.
- inherit & currentColor
- locally scoped custom properties instead always having them up in the root
- content property
- inline-flex
  - to stop the cross line according to the length of the text
- How to use `pseudo classes` in a right way
- transform-origin

### JavaScript
- find & filter methods
- importNode
- htmlFor
