## What I learned📑

- HTML

  - semantic tag naming
  - form action
  - aria-label(input's attribute) : To keep it as accessible as possible, so a screen reader will know what the purpose of this input
  - data-\* Attribute : to store custom data private to the application
  - <template> tag

- CSS

  - grid
  - font-size: calc(7vw + 2rem) : 2rem sets a minimum size - the font can never be smaller than that. And 7 viewport width means - if screen gets bigger, it will grow with the screen, and vice versa.
  - inherit & currentColor
  - locally scoped custom properties instead always having them up in the root
  - content property
  - inline-flex : To stop the cross line according to the length of the text.
  - How to use pseudo classes in a right way
  - transform-origin

- JavaScript

 - find & filter
 - importNode
 - htmlFor
