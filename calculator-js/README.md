# A Calculator with Vanilla JavaScript

- How are we going to store all the information for what's number currrently typed here? => Create a Calculator Class!

- consructor will take all the inputs for it as well as the functions for this calculator.

- constructor is essentially going to take the previousOperandTextElement & currentOperandTextElement. And this is because I need to know where to place the display text for the calculator.
